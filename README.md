This repository contains example of SQL for diverse cases throught out my work. 


### SQL - With Function

**Case**

Given are measurement values obtained from a sensor over multiple days with measurements taken multiple times within each day. Furthermore, within a day, measurements taken at 1st, 3rd, and 5th times are considered odd-numbered measurements, and measurements taken at 2nd, 4th, and 6th times are considered even-numbered measurements.
The SQL query calculates the sum of odd-numbered and even-numbered measurements separately for a particular day. 

**this is bold**

`test`  = commnad + E
