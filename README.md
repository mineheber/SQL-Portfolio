# sql-with function

Given are measurement values obtained from a sensor over multiple days with measurements taken multiple times within each day. Furthermore, within a day, measurements taken at 1st, 3rd, and 5th times are considered odd-numbered measurements, and measurements taken at 2nd, 4th, and 6th times are considered even-numbered measurements.
The SQL query calculates the sum of odd-numbered and even-numbered measurements separately for a particular day and displays the results in two different columns.

Output

measurement_day	        odd_sum	    even_sum
07/10/2022 00:00:00	    2355.75	    1662.74
07/11/2022 00:00:00	    2377.12	    2480.70
07/12/2022 00:00:00	    2903.40	    1244.30
